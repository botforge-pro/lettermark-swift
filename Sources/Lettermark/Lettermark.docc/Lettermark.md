# ``Lettermark``

The mark a thing gets when it has no picture of its own: the letters that go in
the square, and which of the palette's colour slots it is drawn on.

## Drawing a mark

``Lettermark/initials(of:)`` reads the name a reader sees and answers the
letters to draw. What that means depends on the writing system, and the rules
are kept in one place for every port: a name written in two words gives two
letters, one written in Arabic or Han gives one, a Devanagari name gives its
first written syllable rather than a consonant with a halant hanging on it, and
a letter whose uppercase is longer than itself is left alone, so ß stays ß.

```swift
import Lettermark

Lettermark.initials(of: "Wiki Layer")   // "WL"
Lettermark.initials(of: "中文维基")       // "中"
Lettermark.initials(of: "क्षितिज")        // "क्षि"
```

A name with nothing drawable in it answers the empty string. The square is then
painted in the thing's colour with no letters in it, rather than with a "?"
this library invented.

## Choosing the colour

``Palette`` says how many colours you paint and which of them a thing is drawn
on. The colours themselves stay where the rest of your design lives — a colour
catalogue with light and dark variants, a theme, a stylesheet — and the palette
only hands out the index to look up.

```swift
let marks = Palette(slots: 12)
let slot = marks.slot(for: wikiID)
```

The same id always answers the same slot, so a thing keeps its colour between
screens and between runs, and ids that are `slots` apart share one. Building a
palette of fewer than one colour stops the program: that means the code and the
theme disagree, and a slot handed out then would be a colour nobody painted.
